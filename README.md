This repository contains the starter code for project 1 (15-440, Fall 2019). It also contains
the tests that we will use to grade your implementation, and two simple echo server/client
(`srunner` and `crunner`, respectively) programs that you might find useful for your own testing
purposes. These instructions assume you have set your `GOPATH` to point to the repository's
root `p1/` directory.

If at any point you have any trouble with building, installing, or testing your code, the article
titled [How to Write Go Code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) is a great resource for understanding
how Go workspaces are built and organized. You might also find the documentation for the
[`go` command](http://golang.org/cmd/go/) to be helpful. As always, feel free to post your questions
on Piazza.

This project was designed for, and tested on AFS cluster machines, though you may choose to
write and build your code locally as well.

## Part A

### Testing your code using `srunner` & `crunner`

To make testing your server a bit easier we have provided two simple echo server/client
programs called `srunner` and `crunner`. If you look at the source code for the two programs,
you’ll notice that they import the `github.com/cmu440/lsp` package (in other words, they compile
against the current state of your LSP implementation). We believe you will find these programs
useful in the early stages of development when your client and server implementations are
largely incomplete.

To compile, build, and run these programs, use the `go run` command from inside the directory
storing the file (these instructions assume your `GOPATH` is pointing to the project’s root
`p1/` directory):

```bash
go run srunner.go
```

The `srunner` and `crunner` programs may be customized using command line flags. For more
information, specify the `-h` flag at the command line. For example,

```bash
$ go run srunner.go -h
Usage of bin/srunner:
  -elim=5: epoch limit
  -ems=2000: epoch duration (ms)
  -port=9999: port number
  -rdrop=0: network read drop percent
  -v=false: show srunner logs
  -wdrop=0: network write drop percent
  -wsize=1: window 
  -maxUnackMessages=1: maximum unacknowledged messages allowed
  -maxBackoff: maximum interval epoch
```

We have also provided pre-compiled executables for you to use called `srunner-sols` and `crunner-sols`. 
These binaries were compiled against our reference LSP implementation,	
so you might find them useful in the early stages of the development process (for example, if you wanted to test your	
`Client` implementation but haven’t finished implementing the `Server` yet, etc.). Two separate binaries	
are provided under each OS folder in `bin`.


As an example, to start an echo server on port `6060` on an AFS cluster machine, execute the following command:

```sh
$GOPATH/bin/linux_amd64/srunner-sols -port=6060
```

### Running the tests

To test your submission, we will execute the following command from inside the
`p1/src/github.com/cmu440/lsp` directory for each of the tests (where `TestName` is the
name of one of the 44 test cases, such as `TestBasic6` or `TestWindow1`):

```sh
go test -run=TestName
```

Note that we will execute each test _individually_ using the `-run` flag and by specify a regular expression
identifying the name of the test to run. To ensure that previous tests don’t affect the outcome of later tests,
we recommend executing the tests individually (or in small batches, such as `go test -run=TestBasic` which will
execute all tests beginning with `TestBasic`) as opposed to all together using `go test`.

On some tests, we will also check your code for race conditions using Go’s race detector:

```sh
go test -race -run=TestName
```

We have also provided Autolab test scripts mocks in `sh/`. When you are inside the
`p1/src/github.com/cmu440/lsp` directory and execute corresponding script, you can have a rough sense of what your
score should be like on Autolab.

### Submitting to Autolab

As with project 0, we will be using Autolab to grade your submissions for this project.
We will run some&mdash;but not all&mdash;of the tests with the race detector enabled.

To submit your code to Autolab, create a `lsp.tar` file containing your LSP implementation as follows:

```sh
cd p1/src/github.com/cmu440/
tar -cvf lsp.tar lsp/
```

## Miscellaneous

### Reading the API Documentation

Before you begin the project, you should read and understand all of the starter code we provide.
To make this experience a little less traumatic (we know, it's a lot :P),
fire up a web server and read the documentation in a browser by executing the following command:

```sh
godoc -http=:6060 &
```

Then, navigate to [localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/cmu440](http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/cmu440) in a browser.
Note that you can execute this command from anywhere in your system (assuming your `GOPATH`
is pointing to the project's root `p1/` directory).
